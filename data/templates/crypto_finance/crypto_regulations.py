        f"  â€¢ Exchange reporting status: {country2_info.get('exchange_reporting', 'Subject to local regulations')}.\n"
        f"  â€¢ Non-resident obligations may include: {random.choice([

            f"FBAR and/or Form 8938 if U.S. person",

        f"  An investor involved in {activity_type} while being tax resident in {country1} with "
        f"activity on {country2}-based platforms faces complex compliance requirements. "
        f"They should: (1) maintain comprehensive transaction records with fiat values at time "
        f"of transactions; (2) understand the specific treatment of {activity_type} in both "
        f"jurisdictions; (3) identify applicable tax treaties or foreign tax credit provisions; "
        f"(4) engage tax professionals with specific expertise in both jurisdictions and crypto "
        f"taxation; and (5) consider tax compliance technology solutions for cross-border crypto "
        f"activity. As the regulatory landscape evolves, particularly with the implementation of "
        f"the OECD Crypto-Asset Reporting Framework, proactive compliance becomes increasingly important."
